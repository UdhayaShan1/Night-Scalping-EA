# Night-Scalping-EA
Compilation of backtesting and statistics of the mean-reversion strategy
Mean-reversion is a interesting strategy in forex and it can be seen in many other markets too. The key principle is that prices of assets tend to float around a mean value and any fluctations are met by reversions. This idea is well made use of during low volatality hours such as Asian trading session, hence the name night scalping.
